# AMD-GPU-Tool
A next-generation AMD GPU tool capable of reading Core Speeds, Core Voltages, Memory Speeds, Memory Voltages, General BIOS Information, Fan Settings and Temperature Settings. <b>This tool also allows you to set more than just power level 0 and 1 for memory clocks and voltages.</b> Also allows proper saving of profiles.

Instructions:
Compile the XAML and C# files in Visual Studio. Put ecs87NextGearOD.exe in the same folder as your compiled program (the VS program needs to access the ADL through ecs87NextGearOD.exe). Start your compiled program. Press refresh to populate the list of devices (make sure that some kind of dipslay is connected to your AMD Radeon card). Select your device from the dropdown box. Mod responsibly!
